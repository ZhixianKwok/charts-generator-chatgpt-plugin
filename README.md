# ðŸ“Š Charts-Generator-ChatGPT-Plugin

This plugin uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to turn text or URL content into ECharts visualizations. ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

## Description

The Charts-Generator-ChatGPT-Plugin leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT to interpret and analyze user input or web content, and generate corresponding statistical charts using ECharts. It takes a text description or a URL as input, summarizes the content, creates a description that conforms to a statistical chart, and finally converts the description into a chart configuration form that can be implemented by the ECharts library.

Here's a flowchart that illustrates the process:
